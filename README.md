==========

A simple wiki - use it as a personal wiki notebook

Here are steps to get this running on your machine:

1. First, download & install Ruby

2. Then install the 2 gems below:
  * sinatra
  * redcloth

3. Startup the sinatra instance with:

  ruby main.rb

4. Open a browser to: 

  http://localhost:4567


You should see the last page that was modified, which probably is the 'ruby_index' page.

Enjoy!
